# ðŸ“¦ Shopify Theme Development Tool

## System Requirements
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v10.16.3+)
- [NPM 5+](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm)
- [Theme Kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo ( git clone git@github.com:anattadesign/shopify-starter.git ), rename the directory to your project.
2. Open in terminal and and run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
3. In Shopify, copy the theme ID for the new theme, then update the `<PASSWORD>`, `THEME_ID`, and `STORE_URL` in **config.yml** with your store & theme details.
4. Your `config.yml` file should look like this: 
    ```
    development:
      password: <PRIVATE_APP_PASSWORD>
      theme_id: "<THEME_ID>"
      store: <STORE_URL>
      directory: dist/
      ignore_files:
        - config/settings_data.json
    ```
5. Run `yarn start` to run your first Webpack build and start watching for file changes to be uploaded to Shopify.

## Configuration

#### Commands
`yarn start`
- Completes a Webpack build in **development** mode
- Webpack begins watching for file changes
- Theme Kit begins watching for file changes in `dist/`
- Theme Kit opens your development theme in your default browser

`yarn run build`
- Completes a Webpack build in **production** mode

`yarn run deploy`
- Completes a Webpack build in **production** mode
- Deploys and overwrites all theme files via Theme Kit

`yarn run eslint`
- Lint all JavaScript files in `src/js`

#### Entry Points
All JavaScript files in the `js/bundles` directory & subdirectories are used as entry points. All other JavaScript modules should added to additional subdirectories of `js/`. An entry point file must be created for each liquid template file, including alternate templates. A CSS file for each template and layout should also be added to `styles/layout` and `styles/templates`. These CSS files should be imported at the top of each JavaScript entry file.

#### Output Files
Webpack will generate a JavaScript file for each template and layout file in the `bundles` directory. The CSS files imported in each bundle entry file will also generate CSS files. Webpack will add all output files to `dist/assets`.

#### Config
The Theme Kit configuration file uses `dist` as the root directory for watching files to upload.
